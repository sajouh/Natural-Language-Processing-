# Natural-Language-Processing

Disclaimer: This data has been extracted from an udemy machine leanring course in which I was enrolled: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/

The dataset consists of 1000 reviews of a restaurant. The first task is to build a model and train which classifies these reviews as positive and negative, where 1 = +ve review and  0 = -ve review

Secondly the model is deployed to predict 'mew' reviews to deternine from natural language whether a review is +ve or -ve 

Lastly the accuracy of the model is determined using some metric or accuracy scoring sytem.
